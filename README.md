ForkMe
========

This repository is an assignment for Polytechnic School's 2021-2022 Computer Science classes.

Instructions for Students
-------------------------

1. Fork this project into your own GitHub account. You now have a separate copy of the repository.
2. From your GitHub account, get the HTTPS link that will allow you to clone your fork of the project onto your local computer. Copy that into your clipboard.
3. On your local machine, open a Terminal and use `git` to create a clone of your forked version of the project. This is the version of the repository that you will work on when editing this project.
4. Your only assignment for the ForkMe project is this: in the `StudentDirectories` folder make a new directory with your studentID (lastnamefirstinitial), and place a text file `helloitsme.txt` in that directory.
5. Use `git` to add the new directory and its file to the project, and commit this working version of the project. 
6. Now `push` that new commit of the project to your fork on GitHub. You are the only one who has been working on your copy of the fork, so there shouldn't be any issues with updating your main branch.
7. Is your edit good enough to be incorporated into the developer's version of this project? While logged in to your account at GitHub, submit a *pull request* for your fork to be merged into the instructor's original version of the project. If approved, your contributions will become part of the project going forward. *Congratulations! You're a developer!*

Good luck!
